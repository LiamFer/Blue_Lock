                <p>Japan’s desire for <strong>World Cup glory</strong> leads the <strong>Japanese Football
                        Association</strong> to launch a new rigorous
                    training program to find the national team’s next <strong>striker</strong>. Three hundred high
                    school players are
                    pitted against each other for the position, but only one will come out on top. Who among them will
                    be the striker to usher in a <strong>new era</strong> of Japanese soccer?</p>
